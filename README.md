# CompVision_face_detector
College project about computer vision

## Project status:
Done

## What's the project
This project utilize cascade algorithm to detect faces, and crop the dataset. Then the cropped dataset will be trained using one of traditional computer vision algorithm, which is LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms) to create a model that can classify the person face (in this case a famous footballer).

## Toolkit used
- python
- tensorflow
- opencv
